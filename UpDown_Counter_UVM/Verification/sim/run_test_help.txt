This file is for help on how to use the scripts - python or make to run tests.

For running single test - better to use python script 
Different options for python scripts:
It takes 3 values:
   1. test name in uvm / plusarg value in sv
   2. run option (Default = "0")
   3. verbosity (Default = UVM_MEDIUM)

Run options:
   1. For running test from command line (-c option) only for log. => value = "0" or "command_line"
   2. For running test from questa sim - for waveforms => value = "1" or "with_waveform"
   3. For running test from command line - for coverage => value = "2" or "with_coverage"
   3. For running test from command line - for coverage and waveforms => value = "3" or "with_coverage_and_waveform"
   4. For running through visualizer => value = "4" or "visualizer"

--------------------------------------------------------

For running multiple tests(regression) sequentially - use make utility file(Makefile script)
   1. For running all tests and generating coverage report => regress1
   2. For running all tests, generating coverage report and opening coverage report in msim for functional coverage => regress2
   3. For running all tests, generating coverage report and opening coverage report in firefox for mainly code coverage and functional coverage => regress3
   4. For running all tests and generating coverage report and exclude coverage in exclusions.do file => regress4

Makefile other options:
   i. Opening coverage report in msim => cov
   ii. Opening coverage report in firefox => code_cov
   iii. Opening coverage report in msim and then firefox => func_code
   iv. Cleaning up the run directory => clean
   v. Opening all the log files of regression => logs

Example:
   python3 script.py abc_test "1" UVM_MEDIUM
   python3 script.py abc_test with_waveform UVM_MEDIUM
